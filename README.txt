This is a IoT-Project for the course IoT-Cloud Solutions

The goal of the project was to Count Vehicles through a bottleneck in front of my house with a camera and push the collected data into a spreadsheet.
Additionally the script was able to detect the direciton a vehicle was heading. 
This gave me data overview on times, where there is high traffic in front of the House (rush hours).
This script was also able to tell apart passengers and bikes from actual vehicles through the sice of the detected objects.
